This is my first step to understand the thing called GitHub

Hi to all,

I am currentlty taking on the course CS50x from edX. This course has brought me here to GitHub.
Just reading the introductory guide to GitHub. I am obsessed with programming nowadays. Lets see how this GitHub thing goes.

Bye for now.
